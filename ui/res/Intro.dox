     \brief User Interface Resource Management

     This namespace contains components to manage user interface resources; mostly images.

     Most of these classes assume to be run in a background thread (the resource manager thread)
     which is distinct from the UI and the gaming background thread.

     <b>Entry point:</b>

     - ui::res::Manager
