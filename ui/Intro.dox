     \brief User Interface

     This namespace contains user interface kernel.
     This includes the widget class hierarchy including many widget implementations,
     as well as resource management.

     Most of these classes do not assume any particular threading model, i.e. they operate in a single thread (the UI thread).
     Resource management will use a background thread.
