Major Concept Verification
==========================

MULTITHREADED SIMULATOR.
- Make a stripped-down copy of ShipList to copy around.
- Make a simulator-runner with multiple threads.

PLANETSCENTRAL API. The existing API commands mostly map to microservice commands.
We need coarser granularity.
- file/lsgame or file/stat should provide enough information to build a Folder.
- file/ls should produce file hashes to allow client-side caching.


Minor Concept Verification
==========================

UNDO. The dat/dis style is cumbersome and does not map cleanly to Nu or Host data.
- Make a Reverter interface with implementations for v3/Nu/Host.

MAKETURN/SAVE.

ABILITIES/ADVANTAGES.
- Map Nu advantages to racial abilities or configuration.

LOCAL/NETWORK WORKSPLIT.
- Set up complete game directories for network v3 games.
- Cache Nu history results locally.

SERVERS.
- Implement more PlanetsCentral servers within the new infrastructure.

MESSAGES. Can we integrate all messages (in-game messages, PMs, activities, forum, VCR, files) into one interface?
- Make an interface that provides heading/text/parsed data/VCR.
- Cannot load everything locally, only in-game messages.

SCRIPT-BASED TILES. We need tiles 

FILER NG.
- Use SHA-1 addressing (like git) for implicit deduplication.
- Add transaction support: upload many files at once and commit at the end; fork dataspace for backup.
- Add support for symlinks so that user:u/user/path/player9.rst can actually be a link to host:games/0001/out/9/player9.rst.
- Requires export/import for host runs!

SDL2/ANDROID.


Features
========

HOST PREDICTION. We can do history, doing prediction should be possible.

SPECIFICATION BROWSER. A better version of CCShips.
- Browse hulls, engines, beams, torpedoes, abilities.
- Determine abilities such as "2x mining" from config.
- Allow searching for "who can build heaters" or "what are my cloak ships"

MORE HOSTS. Can we do CircusMaximus?
