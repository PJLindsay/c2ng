Major Concept Verification
==========================

MULTITHREADED SIMULATOR.
- Make a stripped-down copy of ShipList to copy around.
- Make a simulator-runner with multiple threads.

PLANETSCENTRAL API. The existing API commands mostly map to microservice commands.
We need coarser granularity.
- file/lsgame or file/stat should provide enough information to build a Folder.
- file/ls should produce file hashes to allow client-side caching.


Minor Concept Verification
==========================

UNDO. The dat/dis style is cumbersome and does not map cleanly to Nu or Host data.
- [DONE] Make a Reverter interface with implementations for v3/Nu/Host.

MAKETURN/SAVE.

ABILITIES/ADVANTAGES.
- Map Nu advantages to racial abilities or configuration.

LOCAL/NETWORK WORKSPLIT.
- [DONE] Set up complete game directories for network v3 games.
- Cache Nu history results locally.

SERVERS.
- [DONE] Implement more PlanetsCentral servers within the new infrastructure.
- Implement integrated router/server.

MESSAGES. Can we integrate all messages (in-game messages, PMs, activities, forum, VCR, files) into one interface?
- Make an interface that provides heading/text/parsed data/VCR.
- Cannot load everything locally, only in-game messages.
- .rss parser for update notifications?

FILER NG.
- [DONE] Use SHA-1 addressing (like git) for implicit deduplication.
- Add transaction support: upload many files at once and commit at the end; fork dataspace for backup.
- Add support for symlinks so that user:u/user/path/player9.rst can actually be a link to host:games/0001/out/9/player9.rst.
- [DONE] Requires export/import for host runs!
- Feasibility proof: backup of around 1360 host runs
    1.1G with compressed backups, 7671 files
       tarball (20161007-hostdata.tar.gz) --> 1028284795 bytes
    5.7G with unpacked backups, 236k files
    2.9G deduplicated, 87k files
       tarball --> 490421264 bytes = 52% savings
    1.1G deduplicated and individually compressed, 87k files
       tarball --> 487724408 bytes
  deduplication: unpack all embedded backups, deduplicate according to SHA1. Many files appear a few thousand times:
  . 5465 x da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 empty file
  . 3237 x 1489f923c4dca729178b3e3233458550d8dddf29 "\0\0"
  . 2824 x abf24fe466a4aebb67df9c09c2e709f08ded11e6 planet.nm (10k)

- TL;DR: deduplication PCc host data needs the same amount of on-disk storage, but reduces backup size in half.
- Initial implementation (without reference counting / cleanup):
  . 291568 user files / 20170224-hostdata
  . 47 minutes conversion time on 'rocket'
  . 7367168k user data (du -sk)
  . 1865827 objects (=write amplification of 6.4)
  . 8340792k object data (du -sk)
  . 1947441k effective object data (file size)
- Implementation with reference counting:
  . 27 minutes conversion time on 'rocket' (~6:30 CPU)
  . 113772 objects (55% savings)
  . 925968k object data (du -sk)
  . 615114k effective object data (file size)
  . 9725501440 bytes written, 7566229504 cancelled (=short-lived objects)
- For reference, with git:
  . 113767 objects
  . 982452k object data with git (du -sk)

SDL2/ANDROID.
- [DONE] Basic port done.
- Touch events!


Features
========

HOST PREDICTION. We can do history, doing prediction should be possible.

SPECIFICATION BROWSER. A better version of CCShips.
- Browse hulls, engines, beams, torpedoes, abilities.
- Determine abilities such as "2x mining" from config.
- Allow searching for "who can build heaters" or "what are my cloak ships"

MORE HOSTS. Can we do CircusMaximus?

OBJECT FILE (*.qc) SUPPORT.


MISC
=====

INTERPRETER REWORKS.
- Constant folding. Translate '"foo" & chr(33)' into a string.
- Rework expressions to reference+deleter style instead of current auto_ptr style.

SUPPORT 8-BPP.
- Need to disable or tweak graphical effects. It's easy to saturate the GUI thread by just scrolling around
  on the main screen.
- Do we still need this?


CLEANUP
========

- client::widgets::BusyIndicator -> ui::widgets
- client::Downlink -> ui::Downlink
- client::dialogs::DirectorySelectionDialog -> ui::dialogs
- util::RequestSender<T> should have a function RequestSender<U> createRelatedSender(Closure<U&(T&)>)
- too much code is using _() for translation
