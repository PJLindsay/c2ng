;=== PCC2ng Resource Index ===
;
;  Syntax is
;    item = file name
;  items are
;    g.foo = graphics
;  (fonts, sounds not implemented yet)
;
;  Names are relative to the resource directory tihs file is in.
;
;  When PCC2 needs an item which has no definition here,
;  it attempts to convert the resource identifier into a file name
;  by turning the colons into directory separators. For example,
;  the image resource
;      vcr.torpedo.5
;  is looked at the assignment
;      g.vcr.torpedo.5
;  and if not found, in the file
;      vcr/torpedo/5.{jpg,png,etc.}
;
;  If this still cannot be found, PCC2 tries generalizing the item
;  by removing trailing components.
;
;  File names:
;  - if a file name ends with a ".", PCC2 tries all supported extensions
;  - two file names separated with "|" means draw second image atop first
;  - the "|" might also be followed by a transformation name:
;    + "size:WIDTH,HEIGHT": resize to WIDTHxHEIGHT. Both WIDTH and HEIGHT
;       must be numbers, optionally with a "%" suffix to resize in relation
;       to the screen size (i.e. "size:50%x100" makes the image half the
;       screen width wide, and 100 pixels tall)
;    + "size:screen": same as "size:100%,100%"
;    + "add:N": only for palettized images: add N to each pixel
;


;--- Control screens
; "planet.X" is a planet of temperature X.
g.planet = planet.png

; "ship.X" is a ship with a given type
g.ship = ship.png

; "base.X" is a base with tech level X
g.base.7 = newbase.png
g.base.8 = newbase.png
g.base.9 = newbase.png
g.base.10 = newbase.png
g.base = oldbase.png

;--- Windows
; "winblue" is some sort of blue marble. We can derive other window
; frame colors from it. For reference, here are some good ones:
;   add:16 = fall (=green/red/yellow)
;   add:48 = pale green
;   add:60 = dark green
;   add:64 = green
;   add:76 = dark yellow
;   add:78 = not so dark greenish yellow
;   add:-24 = orange
;   add:-28 = reddish orange
;   add:-32 = red
;   add:-48 = gray
g.winblue = winblue.
g.winred = winblue.|add:-32
g.wingray = winblue.|add:-48
g.wingreen = winblue.|add:61
g.winyellow = winblue.|add:78
