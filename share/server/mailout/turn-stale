Subject: [PlanetsCentral] Turn file rejected

Hi,

your turn file was REJECTED.
I could not match it to any active game you play.

Probably the file is stale (made from an old result file).
Please submit only turn files made from current results.
You can download your current result file from the game's
home page.
