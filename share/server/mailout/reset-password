Subject: [PlanetsCentral] Password Recovery

Hi,

someone, possibly you, has requested to reset the password for your
account, $(user).


If you wish to reset your password, use the following link:

$(resetlink)

If clicking does not work in your mail program, copy the link into
your web browser's address bar.

This link will take you to a password change form where you can
enter a new password for your account. It will only work for three
days, and until you change the password.


If you do not wish to reset your password, just ignore this mail
and don't use the password change form.
