Subject: [PlanetsCentral] Mail address confirmation

Hi,

someone, possibly you, registered this email address,
  $(email)
on <$(CGI_ROOT)>, a VGAP gaming website, for the user
account "$(user)".


If you wish to associate this email address and this account,
please confirm by clicking the following link:

$(confirmlink)

If clicking does not work in your mail program, copy the link into
your web browser's address bar.

Only this will enable PlanetsCentral to send you any email at all.
You can configure when and how emails are sent on your Settings page,
<$(CGI_ROOT)settings.cgi>.

If you do not confirm your email address, no more mail will be sent.
