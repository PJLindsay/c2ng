PLANETSCENTRAL HACKING GUIDE (c2ng)
***********************************


Introduction
============

  This document gives an overview over the internals of the
  PlanetsCentral servers bundled with PCC2ng.



Overview
=========

  PlanetsCentral consists of a small bunch of application servers each
  providing a specific function.

  - Network services
    + c2file (file store)
    + c2format (binary file parsers for eventual use by web applications)
    + c2host (game hosting: configuration, scheduler)
    + c2mailout (mail queue)
    + c2monitor (status monitor)
    + c2nntp (forum/NNTP adaptor)
    + c2router (c2server multiplexer)
    + c2talk (forum/PMs)

  - Utilities
    + c2console (console for all of the above)
    + c2logger (log file redirector)
    + c2mailin (utility to parse RfC mail and feed it into c2host)
    + c2server (server mode VGAP client)

  (The PCC2 utility distribution also includes c2rater and c2dbdump.)

  These servers use redis as data store, and (optionally) some disk
  directory. They talk to each other using the redis serialisation
  protocol (RESP), which is a simple reliable method of transferring
  array-of-things across a network without escaping/quoting worries.

  The main objectives of splitting PlanetsCentral into servers are
  sharing application logic (e.g. the "create a forum" or "can this
  user access this file" logic is in a central place) and the
  possibility to isolate services by running them in different user
  Ids or containers. Scalability is currently not a goal, a single
  machine can host a VGAP server just fine.

  This architecture style is nowadays refered to as microservices.
  Although the target aims for all services built from the same
  source, running different versions or implementations in one setup
  is an explicitly supported use-case.


Structure of a RESP Server
==========================

Stateless server
----------------

  A stateless server has no per-connection state; all commands will
  produce the same response on every connection (but may modify a
  global state seen by other commands).

  afl::net::NetworkStack (global instance)
         - afl's network stack abstraction. Provides a uniform API
           for Unix/Windows network programming.
  afl::net::Server (one instance)
         - Multi-connection network server. Accepts connections and
           transfers data in and out.
  afl::net::resp::ProtocolHandler (one per connection)
         - RESP protocol parser. Parses incoming commands and formats
           results.
  ServerClass < afl::net::CommandHandler (one instance)
         - The concrete logic is implemented in this class.
  ApplicationClass < server::Application (one instance)
         - The application class performs configuration and contains
           global state.


Stateful server
---------------

  A stateful server has per-connection state. Commands can depend on
  previous commands sent on the same connection.

  Most servers are stateful by their support of the USER command which
  enables access checking.

  afl::net::NetworkStack (global instance)
         - afl's network stack abstraction. Provides a uniform API
           for Unix/Windows network programming.
  afl::net::Server (one instance)
         - Multi-connection network server. Accepts connections and
           transfers data in and out.
  HandlerClass < afl::net::ProtocolHandler (one per connection)
         - Manages lifetime of per-connection/session state.
           Dispatches all calls into its per-connection RESP handler.
         - Typically a SessionProtocolHandler<...>.
  afl::net::resp::ProtocolHandler (one per connection)
         - RESP protocol parser. Parses incoming commands and formats
           results.
  ServerClass < afl::net::CommandHandler (one per connection)
         - The concrete logic is implemented in this class.
  ApplicationClass < server::Application (one instance)
         - The application class performs configuration and contains
           global state.


Implementation of the CommandHandler
------------------------------------

  For each service or service section, there is an interface in
  server::interface.

  MyService
         - abstract base class
  MyServiceClient
         - implementation of MyService that implements methods
           by calling a CommandHandler. This is used by users of the
           service.
  MyServiceServer
         - implementation of afl::net::CommandHandler that calls a
           MyServiceInstance.

  The server-specific folder contains an implementation of MyService
  that contains the actual logic. To implement the CommandHandler of
  a service, it is combined with a MyServiceServer.

  If a service implements multiple sections (e.g. c2talk implementing
  RENDERxxx, FORUMxxx, POSTxxx, etc.), another CommandHandler instance
  is put in front that multiplexes between the sections. All state is
  in a Session class, so the individual CommandHandler can be
  short-lived.


Security Model
--------------

  Essentially, servers assume that everyone who contacts them is
  trusted and has performed user authentication against a user
  database.

  Coming from the "a service is a set of common subroutines" mindset,
  servers do NOT validate user credentials. Access checking is an
  optional feature of servers that must be requested by the caller. A
  server connection starts in unrestricted mode, and can be put in a
  user context using the USER command.

  It is NOT intended to have these servers listen on a
  world-accessible port in the network.

  One implication of this security model is that a stateful server
  connection must NOT auto-reconnect. Connection loss and reconnect
  between a USER command and a function command would execute the
  function command with no access checking.
