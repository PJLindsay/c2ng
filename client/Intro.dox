     \brief Client modules

     This namespace contains everything needed to build graphical (client) applications.
     This includes widgets and management classes.
     Code in this namespace can assume the presence of two threads (UI and worker).

     \change c2ng has fewer custom widgets than PCC2 because of looser coupling to the actual data.
     That is, we have more widgets in namespace ui::widgets.
